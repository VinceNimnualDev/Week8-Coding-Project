<h2>Primary Ground Position</h2>

<h3>Side Control</h3> <!--Level 3 header for 'Side Control'-->
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/sidecontrol.jpg" alt="Side Control"> <!--jpeg insertion for 'Side Control' illustration-->
<p>The side control position, often referred to as "side mount" or simply "side," is a dominant ground position where the practitioner is perpendicular to their opponent, pinning them to the mat with their weight distributed across the opponent's chest or torso. This position provides significant control and restricts the opponent's movement, making it easier to transition to other advantageous positions or apply submission techniques. Essential components of maintaining a solid side control include proper hip positioning, pressure distribution, and the strategic use of grips to neutralize potential escapes.</p> <!--paragraph brief description-->

<h3>Knee on Belly</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/kneeonbelly.jpg" alt="Knee On Belly"> <!--jpeg insertion for 'Knee on Belly' with alternate-->
<p>The "Knee on Belly" position, or "knee ride," is a transitional control point where the practitioner places one knee firmly on the opponent's torso, typically on the diaphragm, while the other leg extends out, foot on the ground, for balance. This position offers both pressure and mobility, allowing the person on top to control their opponent while also being ready to transition to mounts, submissions, or respond to escape attempts. The Knee on Belly position is not only a tool for control but can also be used as a strategic move to prompt reactions from the opponent, which can then be exploited. Proper weight distribution and balance are crucial in maintaining this position without being swept or pushed off.</p> <!--paragraph brief description-->

<h3>Full Mount</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/mount.jpg" alt="Full Mount"> <!--picture insertion for 'Full Mount' with alternate-->
<p>The full mount, commonly referred to simply as "mount," is a dominant ground position where the practitioner straddles atop the opponent's torso, usually with knees placed close to the opponent's armpits, ensuring maximum control. This position grants the person on top a significant advantage, offering a range of submission opportunities while minimizing the threat from the person below. Furthermore, it provides the practitioner with the leverage to apply effective strikes in mixed martial arts contexts. Conversely, the individual at the bottom is rendered largely defensive, with their primary focus being on preventing submissions or strikes and seeking opportunities to escape. Mastery of the full mount is fundamental in Jiu-Jitsu, as it embodies the art's principle of achieving a superior position to control or submit the opponent.</p> <!--paragaph description-->

<h3>Back Mount</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/back-mount.jpg" alt="">
<p>The back mount, often simply referred to as "taking the back," is considered one of the most dominant positions to achieve. Here, the practitioner is positioned behind the opponent with both hooks in place â€” meaning both of the practitioner's legs are interlocked around the opponent's thighs or hips. This position allows the person on top to apply strangles or joint locks with the opponent having limited defensive capabilities since they cannot easily see or anticipate the attacker's movements. Securing the back mount often provides a significant advantage, as it restricts the opponent's movement and exposes their neck to potential submissions like the rear-naked choke. Mastery of the back mount, its entries, control mechanisms, and submissions, is pivotal for success in Jiu-Jitsu, emphasizing the art's philosophy of control and efficiency. <!--paragraph description-->

<h3>Guard</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/guard.jpg" alt="">
<p>The guard is a foundational and versatile position where the practitioner is on their back, using their legs and hips to control and manipulate an opponent who is trying to pass or stabilize on top. The person on the bottom wraps their legs around the opponent's torso, hips, or legs, creating a barrier that the top player must navigate to advance positionally. Unlike many traditional martial arts, the guard in BJJ is not a purely defensive position. Instead, it offers the practitioner a wide range of sweeps, submissions, and transitions. The guard has numerous variations, including the closed guard, open guard, half guard, and spider guard, among others, each with its own set of techniques and strategies. Mastering the intricacies of the guard and its many forms is essential for any Jiu-Jitsu player, as it allows them to defend against more dominant positions and turn the tables on their adversary.</p> <!--paragraph description-->

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<h3>Joint locks</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/armbar.jpeg" alt="armbar"> <!--jpeg insertion for 'armbar'-->
<p>Joint locks are pivotal submission techniques designed to target and manipulate specific joints of the body, forcing an opponent to submit due to pain or the threat of injury. These locks exert controlled pressure on a particular joint, pushing or twisting it beyond its natural range of motion. BJJ encompasses a vast array of joint locks, with some of the most common targeting the elbows, shoulders, wrists, knees, and ankles. The armbar, for instance, targets the elbow joint, while the kimura and Americana manipulate the shoulder. Techniques such as the heel hook or kneebar focus on the leg joints, potentially causing significant damage if not respected. Mastery of these locks requires precise technique and understanding, ensuring effectiveness in application while minimizing the risk of injury during training.</p> <!--paragraph description-->
<h3>Chokes</h3>
<img class="technique-images" src="../images/chokes.jpeg" alt="choke"> <!--jpeg insertion for 'Choke'-->
<p>Chokes, in the realm of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, are submission techniques that constrict the neck, either by compressing the airway (strangles) or obstructing blood flow to the brain by targeting the carotid arteries. The objective is to force an opponent to submit due to a lack of oxygen or reduced blood flow. Unlike joint locks, which cause pain or potential injury, chokes often induce a sensation of panic or lightheadedness in the recipient. Some of the iconic chokes in BJJ include the rear-naked choke, triangle choke, and the guillotine. These techniques can be applied using one's arms, legs, or even the gi (kimono). Chokes are effective and efficient, with a well-applied choke capable of rendering an opponent unconscious in a matter of seconds. As with all submissions, safety is paramount, making timely tapping and attentive practice partners essential in the learning process.</p> <!--paragraph brief description-->
